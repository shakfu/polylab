{- DESCRIPTION

Example 25 - Using the StateT monad transformer
             with the List monad to achieve non-deterministic
             stateful computations, and the Writer monad to
             do logging

Usage: Compile the code and run it with an argument between 1 and 8.
       It will print a solution to the N-queens puzzle along with
       a log of the number of choices it had at each step.
       
       The N-queens puzzle is to place N queens on a chess board
       so that no queen can attack another one.
       
Try: ./ex25 8
     ./ex25 1
     ./ex25 7
